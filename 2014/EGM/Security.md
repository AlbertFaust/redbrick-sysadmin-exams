1. **What is AppArmor?** (2 marks)<br>
AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system which is a kernel Linux Security Module (LSM) enhancement to confine programs to a limited set of resources. 
AppArmor's security model is to bind access control attributes to programs rather than to users. 
AppArmor proactively protects the operating system and applications from external or internal threats, even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good behavior and preventing even unknown application flaws from being exploited. 
AppArmor security policies completely define what system resources individual applications can access, and with what privileges.<br>
2. **What are: pf, fail2ban, iptables** (3 marks)<br>
  * _pf_: Packet Filter is a BSD licensed stateful packet filter, a central piece of software for firewalling. It is comparable to netfilter (iptables), ipfw and ipfilter.  
  * _fail2ban_: An intrusion prevention software framework which protects computer servers from brute-force attacks. 
It is able to run on POSIX systems that have an interface to a packet-control system or firewall installed locally, for example, iptables.  
  * _iptables_: A command-line firewall utility that uses policy chains to allow or block traffic. 
When a connection tries to establish itself on your system, iptables looks for a rule in its list to match it to. 
If it doesnâ€™t find one, it resorts to the default action.  
3. **What does VPN stand for? Why would one be used?** (3 marks)<br>
VPN stands for _Virtual Private Network_. A VPN extends a private network across a public network. 
It enables a computer or network-enabled device to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were directly connected to the private network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and management policies of the private network. <br>
4. **What are SSH keys? What command would you use to configure one?** (3 marks)<br>
SSH keys serve as a means of identifying yourself to an SSH server using public-key cryptography and challenge-response authentication. 
One immediate advantage this method has over traditional password authentication is that you can be authenticated by the server without ever having to send your password over the network. 
Anyone eavesdropping on your connection will not be able to intercept and crack your password because it is never actually transmitted. 
Additionally, using SSH keys for authentication virtually eliminates the risk posed by brute-force password attacks by drastically reducing the chances of the attacker correctly guessing the proper credentials. <br>
`ssh-keygen` is the command used to configure one. <br>
5. **You suspect maK has a rootkit on one of the machines. What command could you run to check for the rootkit?** (3 marks)<br>
*Redbrick Specific*  
6. **You have just installed a new linux server. Name 3 things you should do to secure this system.** (3 marks)<br>
  * Configure iptables and other security software such as fail2ban  
  * Add the line `PermitRootLogin no` to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to disable login as root over SSH. 
  * Enable automatic security updates. To do this on an Ubuntu server:  
  `sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades` this will install the unattended-upgrades package.  
  `sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades` this will enable and configure the default configs.  
7. **Why is ssh as root disabled on our machines?** (2 marks)<br>
8. **Name 3 files that should only be readable by root and what they do.** (4 marks)<br>
9. **Why would you set the sticky bit on a file?** (3 marks)<br>
10. **You left a root terminal unlocked and someone has used it to do something. The history files has been deleted. How do you go about finding out what they did?** (4 marks)<br>
